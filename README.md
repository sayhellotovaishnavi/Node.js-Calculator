## Getting Started

### Step 1: Fork or Download the Repository

1. **Fork the Repository**: Use the GitHub interface to fork this repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <repository_name>
   ```

---

## Running the Application Locally

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have all required dependencies installed. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Application**:
   Start the application locally:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Access the Application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Dockerizing the Application

### Step 2: Create a Dockerfile

1. In the root directory of the project, create a file named `Dockerfile` with the following content:
   ```dockerfile
   # Use Node.js as the base image
   FROM node:14

   # Set the working directory inside the container
   WORKDIR /app

   # Copy package.json and package-lock.json files
   COPY package*.json ./

   # Install dependencies
   RUN npm install

   # Copy the rest of the application files
   COPY . ./

   # Expose the port the app runs on
   EXPOSE 3000

   # Command to run the application
   CMD ["npm", "start"]
   ```

### Step 3: Build the Docker Image

1. Build the Docker image using the following command:
   ```bash
   docker build -t <image_name>:<tag> .
   ```
   Replace `<image_name>` with a name for your image and `<tag>` with the version tag (e.g., `v1`).

### Step 4: Run the Docker Container

1. Run the application inside a container:
   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 <image_name>:<tag>
   ```

2. Access the application in your browser at:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you have Docker installed and running on your machine before proceeding with the Docker-related steps.
- Use `docker ps` to check running containers and `docker stop <container_id>` to stop any container if necessary.
- You can customize the Dockerfile or application as needed.
